## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During the development of this project I could learn two specific knowlegdes that granted me what I needed to finish this project, and none of this would have been possible if my dear friend Henrique Amorim, a full-stack junior developer, haven't teached. This knowledges are:

- Using Flexbox to centralize something. In my case I was changing the margin to centralize things, but I knew it was wrong, that's why I asked my friend to teach me, this way I could learn a new way of how to position things in the screen

- Using CSS Grid to create responsive layout. This was definitly a new thing for me, I didn't even knew about this type of display, Henrique tought me by giving me a challenge, this challenge was to replicate the mobile version, in other word, create a responsive screen. When the screen is compressed, each car's card will be displayed one on top of other

The code that better represent the things I learned are:

```css
.card {
  padding: 3.8rem;
}

.card:nth-child(1) {
  background-color: var(--bright-orange);
  border-radius: 0.5rem 0 0 0.5rem;
}

.card:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: var(--dark-cyan);
}

.card:nth-child(3) {
  background-color: var(--very-dark-cyan);
  border-radius:  0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0 ;
}

@media (max-width: 1200px) {
  .panel {
    margin: 2rem auto;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    max-width: 400px;
  }
}
```
